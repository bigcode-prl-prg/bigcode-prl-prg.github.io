## BigCode: Scalable Analysis of Massive Code Bases

BigCode aims at creating the Institute of Scalable Code Analytics (ISCA) at the Faculty of Information Technology (FIT) of the Czech Technical University in Prague. ISCA will be the first research center in the Czech Republic focused on analyses of large code bases available on the Internet.

BigCode refers to the massive open source codebases available on the Internet. Combining techniques from programming languages and statistical machine learning will allow the mining of these codebases for crucial insights. The requested funds will be invested, in part, to provide FIT with the first hardware and software infrastructure for big code data analysis. The other part of the research funding will attract internationally renowned researchers in the field of computer languages.

The BigCode team is synergistic with existing research capacities at FIT in software and knowledge engineering, data mining and parallel computing. The team is well connected internationally and will bring investment from leading industrial partners that include Google and Oracle.

## Call for PhD Students and Postdocs

We are looking for highly motivated doctoral and postdoctoral candidates who are interested in programming language, systems, and formal methods research and would like to join our team at Czech Technical University in Prague.

We are accepting applications on a continuing basis. Please include your CV and two letters of recommendation.

If you have any questions or would like to apply send email to Christoph Kirsch, ck@cs.uni-salzburg.at
