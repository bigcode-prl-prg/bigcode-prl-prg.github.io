    bio:
    - Joined Czech Technical University, 2016
    - Joined Northeastern, 2014
    - Joined Purdue, 1999
    - PhD, University of Geneva, 1999
    - MSc, University of Victoria, 1995
    note: "I work on the design and implementation of programming languages. I led the implementation of the first real-time Java virtual machine to be flight-tested. With Noble and Potter, I proposed what became known as Ownership Types.  I tried to understand JavaScript by dynamic analysis and am now looking at supporting scalable data analysis in R."

    bio:
    - Joined Czech Technical University, 2016   
    - Worked at 0xdata (Silicon Walley, CA), 2012-2013
    - Worked at SN Systems (Bristol, UK), 2010-2012
    - Graduate Student at Purdue, IN, 2009-2010
    - Erasmus Scholarship at University of Bristol, UK, 2006-2007
    note: "I used to work professionally on PS3 and PS Vita compilers and toolchains. I am interested in design, analysis and optimization of programming languages (mostly dynamic), big code & synthesis and embedded systems. Currently I am working on large scale analysis of code on Github (mostly JavaScript)."

    - Joined Czech Technical University, 2017
    - PhD, Poznań University of Technology, 2017
    note: "I am interested in contributing to programming language research, which is a new field to me. I have a background in distributed computing, concurrency, and transactional memory. I am currently exploring the R language, its compilation, tracing, and static analysis."

    bio:
    - Joined Czech Technical University, 2018
    - PhD, Buenos Aires University, 2017
    note: "My main research interest aims at making programming languages more flexible. I am also interested in ensuring that dynamic PLs do not suffer from prohibitive performance overheads. In addition, I am interested in providing mechanism to help developers reason about the correctness of their programs."
