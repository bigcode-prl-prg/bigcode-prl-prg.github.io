    bio:
    - Joined Czech Technical University, 2020
    - ACM Distinguished Speaker, 2017
    - Visiting Professor at UC  Berkeley, 2014
    - ACM SIGBED chair, 2011-2013
    - Visiting Scholar at UC Berkeley, 2008-2013
    - Co-founder of EMSOFT, 2001
    - Postdoc at UC Berkeley, 1999-2004
    - Dr.Ing. from Saarland University while at the Max Planck Institute for CS in Saarbrücken, 1999
    note: "I am interested in programming languages and systems, in particular concurrent programming and memory management. I also care about formal methods, especially bit-precise reasoning through symbolic execution and bounded model checking. People in computer science know me for co-inventing logical execution time and the embedded programming language Giotto which by now have made their way into modern cars around the world."

    bio: June 2019 - February 2020
#    - Joined Czech Technical University, 2018
#    - PhD, Buenos Aires University, 2017
#    note: "My main research interest aims at making programming languages more flexible. I am also interested in ensuring that dynamic PLs do not suffer from prohibitive performance overheads. In addition, I am interested in providing mechanism to help developers reason about the correctness of their programs."
