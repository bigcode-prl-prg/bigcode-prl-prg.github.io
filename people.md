    note: "I work on the design and implementation of programming languages. I led the implementation of the first real-time Java virtual machine to be flight-tested. With Noble and Potter, I proposed what became known as Ownership Types.  I tried to understand JavaScript by dynamic analysis and am now looking at supporting scalable data analysis in R."
